#This is a To-Do-Application
Its not that special so there is not much to write about it

Its just a basic to-Do app in which you add your next task/goal and it just keeps a track of it.

Clicking on "DONE" button removes the task. Clicking on "REMOVE" also does the same thing.

#UPDATE
I'm still working on it and I will soon add a cache-ing the data so that it stays there even when you refresh the browser.

Also I am looking forward to adding some animation on click on "DONE" or "REMOVE" button.

If you have any suggestions, please feel free to tell me
